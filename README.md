# Portfolio Project

## Scope

Design and develop a website to display my projects and skills to the world while maintaining optimized performance at low cost.

*Due to some API keys needing to be kept private, the source may be slightly different from the live site. That said, the code structure remains the same.*

## Stack

### Jamstack

Jamstack is an architecture designed to serve static web applications quickly and efficiently at low cost. This stack stood out to me because in many cases such as mine. You can achieve free webhosting service through numerous open source CDNs(Content Delivery Network). For more information on Jamstack visit [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/)

### Next + Netlify
